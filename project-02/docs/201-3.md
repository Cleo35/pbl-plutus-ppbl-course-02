# PPBL Course Section 201.3: Minting Native Assets on cardano-cli

Now that you know how to include native assets in a transaction (see 201-2), you know a lot about what you need to *mint* new native assets in a similar transaction. In this section, we will build a minting transaction using `cardano-cli`.

Here is some official (but imperfect) documentation about minting native assets on Cardano: https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/minting/. Take a look at these docs to see how much you already know!

## Cardano Scripts

In software development, you can think of a "script" as a set of instructions. Throughout this course, you will be creating and using scripts that provide instructions to the Cardano Protocol. If you're brand new to this idea, don't worry. In this course, you will learn through experience about the differents kinds of scripts, and the different things they can do on Cardano.

## Native Scripts and Plutus Scripts
At a high level, there are two kinds of scripts that we will use in this course.
1. Native Scripts: can be written by hand and used directly in Cardano transactions
2. Plutus Scripts: are compiled from Plutus code, and used in Cardano transactions

In this lesson, we will work with our first Native Script. In lessons 201.4 and 201.5, we will build and use a Plutus Script. In both cases, our goal is using these scripts is the same: we'd like to mint native assets (aka tokens) on Cardano Testnet.

## Creating a Simple Native Script
Native Scripts consist of a set of rules for taking an action on Cardano. In this case, the action we'd like to take is minting a token. For example, we can write rules defining the signatures required to mint a token. We can also write rules for when a token can or cannot be minted. Let's write a very simple script that has just one rule: a transaction must be signed by a certain Private Key.

1. Create a new directory named `native-scripts`:
```
mkdir native-scripts
cd native-scripts
```
2. Then, create a new file in that directory called `my-first-policy.script`:
```
touch my-first-policy.script
```
3. Open this file and paste the following inside of it:
```
{
    "keyHash": "22117fbd0f86a213ae4f4d824cd0d38eea29e49764ae22f5f50ba3d3",
    "type": "sig"
}
```
This is a Native Script with one rule. `"type": "sig"` means that the rule specifies a signature required by any transaction using the script. The `keyHash` defines *which* signature is required.




```
cardano-cli address key-hash --payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey
```





## Generate a Policy ID:
```
cardano-cli transaction policyid --script-file policy.script
```

## Set Variables
```
POLICYID=
TXIN=
TOKENNAME1=
TOKENNAME2=
POLICYSCRIPT
```

## Minting Transaction:
```
cardano-cli transaction build \
--babbage-era \
--testnet-magic 1097911063 \
--tx-in $TXIN \
--tx-out $MONDAY+"5000000 + 100 $POLICYID.$TOKENNAME1 + 5 $POLICYID.$TOKENNAME2" \
--mint "100 $POLICYID.$TOKENNAME1 + 5 $POLICYID.$TOKENNAME2" \
--mint-script-file $POLICYSCRIPT \
--change-address $MONDAY \
--protocol-params-file ../protocol.json \
--out-file mint-native-assets.raw

cardano-cli transaction sign \
--signing-key-file $MONDAYKEY \
--testnet-magic 1097911063 \
--tx-body-file mint-native-assets.raw \
--out-file mint-native-assets.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit \
--tx-file mint-native-assets.signed \
--testnet-magic 1097911063

```

Just like we saw in 201.2, the --tx-out must balance all native assets. Watch what happens if we don't.
